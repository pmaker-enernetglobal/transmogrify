README - a minimalist macroprocessor.

transmogrify - is a minimalist macro processor that transmogrifies its inputs (transforms as if by magic).

This is based on a minimalist TCL macro based on the idea of generating code that is then exec'ed to
do the actual generation. The syntax is minimalist, every line starting with % is python3 code, every
else is expand using $var and ${var} notation so:

%for n in range(10):
  So $n is ${n}
  But this is just a line
  %if n > 5:
    N is big

Becomes:

  So 0 is 0
  But this is just a line
  So 1 is 1
  But this is just a line
  So 2 is 2
  But this is just a line
  So 3 is 3
  But this is just a line
  So 4 is 4
  But this is just a line
  So 5 is 5
  But this is just a line
  So 6 is 6
  But this is just a line
    N is big
  So 7 is 7
  But this is just a line
    N is big
  So 8 is 8
  But this is just a line
    N is big
  So 9 is 9
  But this is just a line
    N is big
